   near lossless audio quality at up to 328ft (100m).`,
  feature2: `Discover clear, more natural sounding highs than the competition
   with ZX9’s signature planar diaphragm tweeter. Equally important is its powerful
    room-shaking bass courtesy of a 6.5” aluminum alloy bass unit. You’ll be able to
    enjoy equal sound quality whether in a large room or small den. Furthermore, you
    will experience new sensations from old songs since it can respond to even the subtle waveforms.`,
